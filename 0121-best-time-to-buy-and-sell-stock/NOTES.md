Let's understand this problem by an imagination. Imagine you have given a time machine, you can go to past to buy the stock of your choice when the price is very least. And again using that time machine you went into future to sell the stock.

By doing that you have achieve maximum profit. From buying at very least price and selling at very higher price. And you have become rich now!

Now let's just understand it with our given example,
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5

Remember one rule :- You can only buy one time & sell one time

So, if buy at 7 & sell at any time in the future, we'll face loss. Because buying price is way higher then selling price available we have

Now, I have seen a dip & I buy at 1 & sell at 5 my overall profit will be 5 - 1 = 4

But what if, I had buy at 1 & sell at 6 my profit will be 6 - 1 = 5. Which is greater then my overall profit. So, i will update my overall profit with new value.

Now we have done as further we don't have any higher point to sell. We will return our answer.

I hope now question, approach is absolute clear.

code each line explained : Similar for C++, Java

{
        int lsf = Integer.MAX_VALUE; // least so far
        int op = 0; // overall profit
        int pist = 0; // profit if sold today
        
        for(int i = 0; i < prices.length; i++){
            if(prices[i] < lsf){ // if we found new buy value which is more smaller then previous one
                lsf = prices[i]; // update our least so far
            }
            pist = prices[i] - lsf; // calculating profit if sold today by, Buy - sell
            if(op < pist){ // if pist is more then our previous overall profit
                op = pist; // update overall profit
            }
        }
        return op; // return op
